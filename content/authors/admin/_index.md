bio:
---

I am currently a graduate student in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley and
a researcher at the [Berkeley Speech & Computation Lab](https://twitter.com/BerkeleySCLab).
My interests and experience coincide in seamlessly combining computationally-intensive approaches
with more traditional analytical methods in diverse fields.

Master's thesis (Diploma) in Mathematical Physics: Time-dependent current through a quantum dot in the presence of a voltage probe (in Slovene)
{{< /staticref >}}[^1].

[^1]: <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:0.7em;"> NOTE: The document significantly compresses the theoretical background of the thesis, which is to be found in the referenced works, since it falls outside of the Diploma program and recommended thesis format. The focus of the work is on the empirical results, which can be appreciated even with the compressed background.
