<p><em>NOTE: This is a migration of an old post from my <a href="https://andleb1.wordpress.com/2020/03/08/a-simple-gmat-practice-set-generator/">previous blog</a></em></p>
<p>I recently sat for the GMAT. To practice smarter, I came up with a simple <em>Official Guide 2020</em> problem set generator in Python.
The motivation came from my dissatisfaction with available solutions, for example, the solution you get by registering the book online.
Some don’t allow you to narrow the problems down by sub-category, others aren’t random generators or don’t keep track of done problems.
On the other hand, using my simple generator, you can still input the answers in any online system and thus take advantage of any statistics offered.</p>
