<p><em>NOTE: This is a migration of an old post from my <a href="https://andleb1.wordpress.com/2020/05/28/how-to-call-all-the-functions-in-a-python-file-on-an-object/">previous blog</a></em></p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been playing around with some competitions on Kaggle. Given that an inescapable fact of Machine Learning is <em>Feature Selection</em>,
I’ve been finding myself in the situation of having to call a dozen or more functions that add synthetic features,
infer missing values, etc., on the same <code>Pandas DataFrame</code>.</p>
<p>The following code snippet will call every function in its <code>.py</code> file but itself on the object,
using tail recursion (nested helper function <code>recCall</code>):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import inspect
import sys
 
import pandas as pd
 
def addAllFeatures(data: pd.DataFrame):
    currFunc  = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe()).function
    functions = [obj for name, obj in
                 inspect.getmembers(sys.modules[__name__])
                 if (inspect.isfunction(obj) and name != currFunc)]
 
    def recCall(modifiedData, remFuncs):
        if len(remFuncs) == 0:
            return modifiedData
         
        return recCall(remFuncs[0](modifiedData), remFuncs[1:])
 
    return recCall(data, functions)</code></pre>
<p>For this specific example, the general form of the feature-adding functions is:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def addFeature(data: pd.DataFrame, *args, **kwargs):
     
    # add the feature ...
     
    return data</code></pre>
<p>Also notable is the fact that the data gets modified between calls of the recursion;
if your features depend on each other, then the <code>functions</code> list would need to be in the correct dependency order.
Determining this can, however, quickly become non-trivial.</p>
