<p><em>NOTE: This is a migration of an old post from my <a href="https://andleb1.wordpress.com/2020/10/02/the-githubs-arctic-code-vault/">previous blog</a></em></p>
<p>Something extremely <em>cool</em> happened to two of my GitHub repositories (please pardon the pun).
Namely, they were included in Github’s Arctic Vault Archive program.</p>
<p>In short, GitHub has partnered with a Norwegian company to write some of the repositories to special,
durable film reels and deposit them 250 meters underground in an abandoned coal mine in the remote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard">Svalbard islands</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, about 200 3500-foot (1km) reels of film were thus deposited.</p>
<p>Given how often we hear the familiar complaint of the supposed transience of modern products,
it is uplifting to see a company take a concrete action to remedy this.
As for myself, I am deeply honored to have something that I created preserved for posterity.</p>
