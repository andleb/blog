I recently helped present our work (together with [Prof. Gašper Beguš](https://twitter.com/BerkeleySCLab), [paper]({{< relref "/publication/causalCETI" >}})) 
on the usage of deep generative models for discovering the building blocks of sperm whale communication at the [*Decoding Communication in Nonhuman Species*](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/decoding-communication-nonhuman-species-ii-co-hosted-project-ceti) symposium hosted
at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage), UC Berkeley:
