This is my final project for *STAT230A: Linear Models* at UC Berkeley in Spring 2022, done jointly with [Isaac Schmidt](https://ischmidt20.github.io).

The goal was to replicate the findings of [Michalopoulos: The Origins of Ethnolinguistic Diversity](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.4.1508). The project took an additional dimension since we couldn't obtain some of the data used in the paper - the [WLMS dataset](https://www.worldgeodatasets.com/language/), prompting us to recreate a portion of the paper using the [GREG dataset](https://icr.ethz.ch/data/greg/).

The main finding of the paper, which also bore out in our re-analysis using the alternative dataset, is that the *variation* in the elevation and in the land quality (see the map above) are the two most decisive factors in driving a region's ethnolinguistic diversity.
