A few years back, I undertook a significant study of mathematical finance. I chiefly followed M. Joshi's [Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521514088) and [More Mathematical Finance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0987122800).
Since the companion practical textbook, [C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521721628),
was based on outdated, pre-`C++11` paradigms, and the author has sadly passed away, I decided to rewrite the latter in modern C++. 
The goal was to keep the original spirit while adding advanced functionality.
I hope that other people studying from the same sources find the project useful, and I have thus, in a small way, helped keep the book relevant.
